# From Marc {.centered}

I just wanted to say that I love you.
Jess and I are praying for you :)

1. that you would Honor God
2. that God challenge you in ways that make you dependant on Him
3. that you will lift other people up while you are in NY (you have a lot to give!)

Thanks for being such an awesome brother and I am looking forward to seeing you soon!

Love, Marc

Dear Benji,

Happy Fall!!

I hope you’re doing pretty awesome up there in my home state, though a bit colder than where I was:)  NY is pretty cool:)

We miss you here!  We were together last week to celebrate your grandma’s birthday and Marc commented, “It’s different without Benji being here.”  It’s true!  I’ve said the same myself.  We miss you:)

But!  We are so glad you are there, learning new things and growing in faith in God.  Taking new steps requires faith!  Did you know all we need is a mustard seed of faith?  It’s what God asks of us above all else -

### Faith.

Just a little:)  And sometimes thats barely much at all!
In the Bible, a father had a child with life long issues that didn’t seem to be going away.  Bringing him to Jesus, he said, “I believe, help my unbelief!”  And Jesus healed his son.
(Mark 9:23)

It’s a good word to say to Jesus too.  Especially for us worries and big thinkers:)

“Help me have faith, God.”


Enjoy your new friends and old ones too!!
Let’s call sometime!

Love you,

-Jess your new sis
